# BetrApp

Betr is a technology built to bridge the gap between impoverished women and a sustainable solution. 
Built in Angular using HTML, CSS, SASS, and Javascript.


I pitched this in The Iron Yard Cohort 5 and recruited one other front end engineer and two back end engineers to complete it in 3 short weeks. The back end was created using Java in Spring.
